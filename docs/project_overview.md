# Fusion Tokamak Research Project Overview

## Introduction
Nuclear fusion through tokamak reactors represents a promising path to clean, abundant energy. This project focuses on plasma physics, magnetic confinement technology, and the practical implementation of fusion for electrical power generation.

## Key Research Questions

1. **Plasma Confinement**
   - How can magnetic field configurations improve plasma stability?
   - What techniques can extend confinement time and increase plasma density?

2. **Energy Extraction**
   - What are the most efficient methods for converting fusion heat to electricity?
   - How can materials withstand the extreme conditions in a fusion reactor?

3. **Fuel Cycle**
   - How can tritium breeding be optimized in a commercial reactor?
   - What recycling technologies minimize tritium losses?

4. **Economic Viability**
   - Under what conditions does fusion power become economically competitive?
   - What financing models might accelerate fusion development?

## Methodology
This project will combine:
- Computer modeling of plasma physics in tokamak configurations
